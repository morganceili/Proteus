*Unit Testing*
In a nutshell, you throw an input into a unit test, and take the output and check to make sure it's what you expected. Units are individual modules, classes, or methods inside a larger program. 
- in Proteus, we give it an end-to-end test, where the whole compiler is tested, and the output is a C++ file

*Mutation-based Testing*
Have some inputs that are provided (seeds), modify tests in the seed to produce new tests. 

*Mutation Testing*
This technique is used to measure the effectiveness of your tests (you're generating mutants on purpose). If your mutant survives, your test suite is missing something. 

*Blackbox Testing*
Strictly looking at interfaces and signatures

*Whitebox Testing*
Looking at all the code

**Just because all the code is covered in a test does not mean it's bug-free**
