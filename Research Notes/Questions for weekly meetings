When a message is passed down, is it passed down to the leaf state to the be traversed back up, triggering any necessary events on the way back up?


- Watching Proteus semantics: 
    - S1 has an on block, so S2 inherits. does that mean substates inherite the code from their superstates?
    - does monitors mean literal computer monitors?
