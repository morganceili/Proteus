- Top-most initial transition is attached to the transition itself. This transition can cut through nested states and reach the intended sub-state. Any state it cuts through must still be properly entered to get to the target state
    - Top-down entry action example where s2 is the target state: top-INIT; s-ENTRY; s2-ENTRY; 2-INIT
    - Not sure if this is standard or if it only applies when the target state also has an initial state

Questions regarding lesson #42: he talks about the path that transitions take, is it specific to his example or is it the process the same across the board?

When a message is passed down, is it passed down to the leaf state to the be traversed back up, triggering any necessary events on the way back up?

self transition vs internal transition?

what is an initial transition? is it triggered by an active object?

entry actions vs exit actions - I believe exit actions are the action that executes as you exit a state?

with compilers: identifier token?
